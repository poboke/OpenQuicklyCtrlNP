### What's this
Xcode's Open Quickly(shortcut: `cmd`+`shift`+`o`) is a very convenient tool. You can go around by keeping your hands on the keyboard.
However, it only supports the arrow key navigation, which means you have to move you right hand out of the main area.

This plug-in gives the Open Quickly the lost control-n/p navigating function.

> In my opinion, it's not hard at all to support the control-n/p navigation in the Open Quickly dialog. I really hope the Xcode team would add this lost function in the future.

* I tested this only on Xcode 5.1 and Xcode 6 beta 5.

### Installation
You can either

* Use [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/)
* Download(Clone) the source and build it(`cmd` + `B`) in Xcode.

Then restart Xcode.

### Uninstallation
Just delete:
